Requirements for packaging and uploading a Python module to PyPI

Prerequisites

Latest versions of pip, setuptools, wheel.

Install twine for uploading:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel twine

Python Packaging

Project layout & required files

setup.py at the project root calling setuptools.setup(...) with your metadata.

Optionally setup.cfg or pyproject.toml for declarative metadata per PEP 621.

A top-level package directory (often src/<your_package>/) containing an __init__.py.

README.rst or README.md, referenced via long_description/long_description_content_type.

LICENSE file detailing distribution terms.

MANIFEST.in if you need to include additional non-code files not auto-included.

Metadata (in setup() or [project])

name: unique across PyPI

version: semantic version

description, author, author_email

license, classifiers

packages or py_modules

install_requires (your dependencies)
Python Packaging

Building distributions

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m pip install build
python3 -m build  # produces .tar.gz and .whl in dist/
Python Packaging

Uploading to PyPI

Create a PyPI account and generate an API token at https://pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens

Install twine (if not already).

Upload everything in dist/:

bash
Copy
Edit
twine upload dist/*
(Optional) Configure ~/.pypirc with your token so you’re not prompted each time.

Name uniqueness
Choose a memorable, unused name. If your desired name already exists on PyPI, pick another or, if the existing project is abandoned, request a name transfer under PEP 541.

Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)

Are clones allowed?

Under PyPI’s Terms of Use, by uploading you warrant that you have the right to redistribute the exact content you upload, either under its included license (e.g. MIT, BSD, Apache) or via the irrevocable license you grant when uploading 
Python Policies
.

Cloning another project’s code and re-publishing it on PyPI is only permitted if that code’s open-source license allows redistribution and you comply fully (including carrying over license text, notices, etc.) 
Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)
.

Name conflicts: PEP 541 prohibits uploading a clone under the same project name while the original maintainer remains reachable (name squatting or active-project conflict). You must use a unique name, or follow PEP 541’s process to request transfer if the original is abandoned

The Google Gen AI Python SDK provides a strongly-typed interface where you construct rich Content and Part objects to represent user prompts, tool invocations, and even multimedia inputs, all wrapped in Pydantic models for validation and conversion . In contrast, the OpenAI Python client takes a more free-form approach: you pass strings or message dictionaries directly to methods like client.responses.create or client.chat.completions.create, with streaming enabled via stream=True to yield SSE event objects . Both libraries support real-time streaming, but Google offers a dedicated generate_content_stream generator emitting chunk.text pieces, while OpenAI surfaces raw Server-Sent Events that you iterate over in a loop . Function calling is first-class in both: Google lets you pass actual Python functions or declare them manually with FunctionDeclaration, whereas OpenAI uses JSON-schema-defined specs under the functions parameter in chat completions

API Design and Data Modeling
Google Gen AI SDK
The SDK’s types.Content and types.Part classes represent every piece of a conversation—text, images, function calls—ensuring well-formed payloads and automatic grouping of simple inputs into UserContent objects .

Supplying a plain string, list of strings, or even URIs triggers automatic conversion into the appropriate Content subclass (e.g., types.UserContent or types.ModelContent) so you rarely write raw JSON .

Under the hood, all Pydantic models validate against Google’s API schemas, catching mismatches early in your development workflow .

OpenAI Python Client
The OpenAI library embraces standard Python types: strings for prompts and lists of message dictionaries for chat, reducing boilerplate and allowing quick prototyping .

Nested configurations (like response_format or JSON schema for functions) are passed as plain dicts or TypedDict, with optional use of helper classes for clarity .

Error handling surfaces as subclasses of openai.APIError, keeping exception semantics consistent across sync and async clients .

Function Calling Support
Google Gen AI SDK
Automatic function invocation: Pass a real Python function to GenerateContentConfig(tools=[get_current_weather]) and the SDK will detect, call, and insert the result back into the conversation seamlessly .

Manual control: Define types.FunctionDeclaration and wrap it in types.Tool, then manually assemble Content parts for the function call and its response, offering full visibility into each step of the round trip .

OpenAI Python Client
Schema-driven functions: Supply a list of function specifications (name, description, JSON Schema) to functions=[...] in chat.completions.create and set function_call="auto" or a specific function name to steer invocation 
platform.openai.com
medium.com
.

Response parsing: Iterate over the SSE stream; extract message["function_call"] chunks, parse the arguments string into a dict, execute your Python function, and optionally issue a follow-up completion with the function’s result 
community.openai.com
.

Streaming Responses
Google Gen AI SDK
Synchronous streaming: Call client.models.generate_content_stream(model, contents) to receive an iterator of chunk objects; each chunk.text holds the next piece of the model’s output .

Asynchronous streaming: Use async for chunk in client.aio.models.generate_content_stream(...) in async contexts, mirroring sync behavior with native await support .

OpenAI Python Client (SSE)
Server-Sent Events: Enabling stream=True on client.responses.create (or client.chat.completions.create) returns an SSE stream; each yielded event contains raw JSON payloads with delta content updates .

Event forwarding: You can proxy these SSE events through frameworks like FastAPI or OpenFaaS, instantly relaying model output to clients as it arrives .

Ease of Use and Flexibility
Google’s SDK excels when you need highly structured, multimodal interactions (text, images, audio) and tight integration with Python function ecosystems, trading some simplicity for rigor and type safety .

OpenAI’s approach lowers the barrier to entry: minimal wrapper code, direct JSON-style parameters, and an SSE-centric streaming model that slots into any Python event loop or request-response cycle .

Conclusion
Both SDKs surface powerful generative AI capabilities but cater to different developer priorities: Google’s SDK leans into structured, type-safe APIs with built-in multimedia and function-calling abstractions, while the OpenAI Python client champions flexibility, simplicity, and broad SSE-based streaming support. Choose the one that best aligns with your project’s architecture and workflow needs.
